   pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
   ```

   Make sure you have the `alpaca_mcp_server.py` in the same directory and that it's properly configured with your Alpaca API credentials in the `.env` file.
   
   The Streamlit app will automatically import and use the MCP server functions directly.

   - **Maximum Days to Expiration**: Filter options by time to expiration
   - **Maximum Probability ITM**: Set risk tolerance (lower = safer)
   - **Minimum Open Interest**: Ensure adequate liquidity

3. **Click "Analyze Options"** to run the analysis

   - Summary metrics at the top
   - Complete results table with all opportunities
   - Top 3 recommendations with detailed breakdowns
   - Download CSV for further analysis

## Key Metrics Explained

- **PITM (Probability ITM)**: Estimated probability the option will be in-the-money at expiration
- **Annualized Return**: The premium income annualized based on days to expiration
- **Cash Required**: Total cash needed to secure the put (strike price Ã— 100)
- **Premium Income**: Total premium received for selling the put
- **Distance to Strike**: How far the current stock price is from the strike price

## Cash-Secured Put Strategy

A cash-secured put involves:
1. **Selling a put option** on a stock you'd like to own
2. **Setting aside cash** equal to 100 shares at the strike price
3. **Collecting premium** immediately
4. **Potential outcomes**:
   - Stock stays above strike: Keep premium as profit
   - Stock falls below strike: Acquire shares at strike price (discount to original price)

## Risk Considerations

- **Assignment Risk**: You may be required to purchase shares if the stock falls below the strike
- **Opportunity Cost**: Cash is tied up during the option period
- **Market Risk**: Stock prices can be volatile
- **Liquidity Risk**: Some options may have low trading volume

## Requirements

This application requires:
- **Alpaca MCP Server**: The `alpaca_mcp_server.py` file in the same directory
- **Alpaca Account**: Available at [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets) with API credentials configured
- **MCP Server Setup**: Ensure the MCP server has proper `.env` configuration

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Alpaca MCP server is not running"**: Ensure `alpaca_mcp_server.py` is in the same directory and properly configured
2. **"Could not import alpaca_mcp_server module"**: Verify the MCP server file is in the same directory as the Streamlit app
3. **"No options found"**: Try adjusting filters (increase max DTE or max PITM)
4. **"Import error"**: Ensure all required packages are installed

**Getting Help:**

- Check the Alpaca Markets documentation for API issues
- Verify your account has options trading enabled
- Ensure you're using paper trading credentials for testing
