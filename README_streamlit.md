# Cash-Secured Put Options Analyzer

A Streamlit web application for analyzing and comparing cash-secured put options to find the best opportunities for generating income while potentially acquiring stocks at a discount.

## Features

- **MCP Integration**: Uses the Alpaca MCP server for data fetching (no direct API calls needed)
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live stock quotes and options data through the MCP server
- **Multiple Symbol Analysis**: Compare options across multiple stocks simultaneously
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by days to expiration, probability ITM, and open interest
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Calculate annualized returns, cash requirements, and risk metrics
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web interface with real-time updates
- **Greeks Integration**: Uses real option Greeks (Delta, Theta, etc.) from Alpaca when available

## What the Application Provides
- Interactive parameter selection in the sidebar
- Real-time progress tracking during analysis
- Comprehensive results table with color-coded returns
- Parallel processing for faster multi-symbol analysis
- Data source transparency (shows real vs estimated data)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure the Alpaca MCP server is running**:
   Make sure you have the `alpaca_mcp_server.py` in the same directory and that it's properly configured with your Alpaca API credentials in the `.env` file.
   
   The Streamlit app will automatically import and use the MCP server functions directly.

## Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run cash_secured_puts_app.py
   ```

2. **Configure analysis parameters** in the sidebar:
   - **Stock Symbols**: Enter comma-separated ticker symbols (e.g., PLTR,UNH,LLY)
   - **Maximum Days to Expiration**: Filter options by time to expiration
   - **Maximum Probability ITM**: Set risk tolerance (lower = safer)
   - **Minimum Open Interest**: Ensure adequate liquidity
   - **Fast Processing**: Enable parallel processing for multiple symbols

3. **Click "Analyze Options"** to run the analysis

4. **Review results**:
   - Complete results table with color-coded returns
   - Best opportunity per ticker (highest annualized return)
   - Real-time data source indicators
   - Comprehensive options metrics and Greeks

## Key Metrics Explained

- **Annual Return %**: The premium income annualized based on days to expiration
- **PITM (Probability ITM)**: Estimated probability the option will be in-the-money at expiration (calculated using real Delta when available)
- **Cash Required**: Total cash needed to secure the put (strike price Ã— 100)
- **Premium Income**: Total premium received for selling the put
- **Distance to Strike**: Safety margin - how far the current stock price is above the strike price
- **Greeks**: Real option sensitivities (Delta, Theta) from Alpaca when available
- **Data Source**: Shows whether using "Alpaca_Real" or "Estimated" calculations

## Cash-Secured Put Strategy

A cash-secured put involves:
1. **Selling a put option** on a stock you'd like to own
2. **Setting aside cash** equal to 100 shares at the strike price
3. **Collecting premium** immediately
4. **Potential outcomes**:
   - Stock stays above strike: Keep premium as profit
   - Stock falls below strike: Acquire shares at strike price (discount to original price)

## Risk Considerations

- **Assignment Risk**: You may be required to purchase shares if the stock falls below the strike
- **Opportunity Cost**: Cash is tied up during the option period
- **Market Risk**: Stock prices can be volatile
- **Liquidity Risk**: Some options may have low trading volume

## Current Limitations

The following features are not yet implemented:
- **CSV Export**: Download functionality for results
- **Volume Filtering**: Volume filter UI exists but not functional
- **Summary Dashboard**: Portfolio-level metrics overview
- **Watchlist Integration**: Import symbols from Alpaca watchlists

## Requirements

This application requires:
- **Alpaca MCP Server**: The `alpaca_mcp_server.py` file in the same directory
- **Alpaca Account**: Available at [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets) with API credentials configured
- **MCP Server Setup**: Ensure the MCP server has proper `.env` configuration

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Alpaca MCP server is not running"**: Ensure `alpaca_mcp_server.py` is in the same directory and properly configured
2. **"Could not import alpaca_mcp_server module"**: Verify the MCP server file is in the same directory as the Streamlit app
3. **"No options found"**: Try adjusting filters (increase max DTE or max PITM)
4. **"Import error"**: Ensure all required packages are installed

**Getting Help:**

- Check the Alpaca Markets documentation for API issues
- Verify your account has options trading enabled
- Ensure you're using paper trading credentials for testing
